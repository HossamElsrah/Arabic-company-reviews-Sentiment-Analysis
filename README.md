### Arabic Customer Review Analysis: A Sentiment Analysis Project Using Deep Learning

This project is a practical application of sentiment analysis on a dataset of Arabic company reviews. The goal of this project is to help companies automatically and quickly understand their customers' sentiments, which can contribute to improving the quality of their services and products.

#### ðŸ’¡ Project Objectives

  * **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify customer reviews into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
  * **Deep Learning:** Utilize an advanced **Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to model and understand the context of Arabic texts.
  * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Apply various techniques for Arabic text processing, such as cleaning and tokenization, to prepare the data for the model.
  * **Practical Application:** Provide a simple tool that companies can use to analyze large volumes of reviews and understand the general trend of customer sentiment.

#### ðŸ¤– Technical Components

  * **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
  * **TensorFlow & Keras:** Used to build, train, and manage the deep learning model.
  * **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  * **Scikit-learn:** For data splitting and model performance evaluation.
  * **Numpy:** For handling arrays and numerical data.
  * **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For visualizing analysis results and performance reports.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

The model demonstrated strong performance in predicting the sentiment of positive and negative reviews with high accuracy. However, it faced a challenge in classifying the neutral category. This is likely due to the significant data imbalance, as the number of neutral reviews is very small compared to the other classes.
